## 📝Detailed Features
#### 🔰 The project is divided into two parts.
1. First part being development of the Graphical User Interface 
2. The second being development of a package to fetch color palettes in hex format. 
#### 🔰 The package for color palette generation implements fetching of colors from color picker in various modes which includes:
1. Random color palette geenration.
2. Light and Dark shades of a particular color.
#### 🔰 To generate the same shade palettes, I used the library seaborn.
#### 🔰 For generating palette from image, I used K-means clustering algorithm provided by sci-kit learn.

<br>

## 🚀 Technologies
#### All the code was built in [Python3](https://www.python.org/). With a blend of my first experience with the library [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/).
